  "description": "Self-Taught Bytes is a blog website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, where I document my journey of becoming a self-taught web developer. Currently, it's a frontend-only project, but I plan to integrate a backend using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to enhance functionality and gain full-stack development experience. This project serves as both a practice ground for my skills and a platform to share insights, challenges, and progress along the way. ðŸš€",
